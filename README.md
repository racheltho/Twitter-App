# Twitter-App

Required features:
- User can sign in using OAuth login flow
- User can view last 20 tweets from their home timeline
- The current signed in user will be persisted across restarts (notice that I restart the simulator halfway through the licecap and remain logged in)
- In the home timeline, user can view tweet with the user profile picture, username, tweet text, retweet count, and favorite count
- User can pull to refresh
- User can compose a new tweet by tapping on a compose button.

I spent 13 hours on this app. I was sick this week and not able to put in as much time as I'd liked.  I ran out of time before I got to the retweet/favorite functionality.  Also, I had a frustrating bug with xconfig that I never got resolved.
