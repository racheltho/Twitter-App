# Twitter-App

Note: I updated this project on 2/24.  The version from Sunday evening (2/22) when this assignment was due is [here] (https://github.com/racheltho/Twitter-App/tree/7470cb6dd3a8b00cf50afea9d070f7e48ea0c2f0).

Required features:
- User can sign in using OAuth login flow
- User can view last 20 tweets from their home timeline
- The current signed in user will be persisted across restarts (notice that I restart the simulator halfway through the GIF and remain logged in)
- In the home timeline, user can view tweet with the user profile picture, username, tweet text, retweet count, and favorite count
- Pull to refresh
- User can compose a new tweet by tapping on a compose button.
- User can reply, retweet, or favorite a tweet.  For retweet/favorite, the count updates immediately (without reloading page) and retweet/favorite icons switch to "on" version.
